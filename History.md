New version number scheme as I can't use svn:keywords to have a directly downloadable version with an autogenerated embedded version number (see [Google Code support issue 1379](http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=1379)).

## 2008-08-06 ##
[First public release: #2](http://code.google.com/p/curlie/source/browse/trunk/curlIE.wsf?r=2).

## 2008-07-09 ##
Implemented -o and binary files saving using ADODB.Stream.

## 2007-09-01 ##
Initial implementation of curlIE (which I called mini-curl at the time). Most of the code is the command line parsing to match [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/).

First basic implementation of a basic generic download tool in WSH.

## 2006-07-09 ##
My first experiment with XMLHttpRequest in WSH to explore the Google geocoding API.
